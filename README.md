# Python Data Science Projects

This repository contains three data science projects implemented in Python:

1. [Credit Card Fraud Detection](#credit-card-fraud-detection)
2. [Titanic Survival Prediction](#titanic-survival-prediction)
3. [Iris Flower Classification](#iris-flower-classification)

## Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Overview
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Using machine learning techniques, this project builds models to differentiate between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions based on transaction data.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle. It contains 284,807 transactions, with 492 frauds.


## Titanic Survival Prediction
### Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction project uses the Titanic dataset to predict the survival of passengers. The goal is to apply classification algorithms to determine the likelihood of a passenger's survival based on features like age, sex, class, and fare.

### Dataset
The dataset for this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It includes information on 891 passengers.
